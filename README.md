#Vapor unit test sample
This sample is kindly provided by Stephen Seaton-Blanchard in relation to an article describing unit testing vapor/swift in a cross platform environment.
The article can be found at http://seatoncode.com/unit-testing-vapor/ and would no doubt clear up any questions relating to this packages contents.
